# How to Contribute to Kanali

## Getting Started
This project uses [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) to manage dependencies. If not found locally, `make install` will bootstrap it locally.

Use the following commands to bootstrap a local development environment for Kanali. Note that Kanali is built using Go version `1.10`.

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/northwesternmutual
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/northwesternmutual
$ git clone https://github.com/northwesternmutual/kanali.git
$ cd kanali
$ make install
```

## Testing

This project contains a robust suite of unit and end-to-end (e2e) tests. Instructions detailing how to execute these suites are given below:

#### unit

```sh
$ make unit_test
```

#### e2e

This test suite requires a running Kubernetes cluster. Bootstrap a local one as follows:

```sh
$ minikube start --kubernetes-version v1.9.0 --feature-gates CustomResourceValidation=true
```
If you would like to run this test suite against local changes, it is necessary to create a container image with these changes. This can be done in the following manner. Note that many other aspects of this test suite are configurable via environment variables. Reference [this](./hack/e2e.sh) for a list of these variables.

```sh
$ eval $(minikube docker-env)
$ ./hack/docker-build.sh
```

Execute the e2e test suite:

```sh
$ make e2e_test
```

## Project Structure

Below is an overview of this project's structure (not all files are listed):

```sh
github.com/northwesternmutual/kanali
  cmd/                - All binaries
    kanali/
      app/            - Code for binary
      main.go
  examples/           - Examples of all resources in the kanali.io API group
  hack/               - Miscellaneous project scripts
  docs/               - Hugo assets for documentation site
  helm/               - Helm chart for Kanali
  logo/               - Logo assets
  pkg/                - (See footnote 1)
  test/               - Integration and e2e tests
  Gopkg.toml          - Project dependencies
```

<sup>1</sup> `pkg` is a collection of utility packages used by the Kanali components without being specific to its internals. Utility packages are kept separate from the core codebase to keep it as small and concise as possible. If some utilities grow larger and their APIs stabilize, they may be moved to their own repository, to facilitate re-use by other projects.

## Imports Grouping
This projects adheres to the following pattern when grouping imports in Go files:
* imports from standard library
* imports from other projects
* imports from internal project

In addition, imports in each group must be sorted by length. For example:
```go
import (
  "context"
  "net/http"

  "go.uber.org/zap"
  opentracing "github.com/opentracing/opentracing-go"

  "github.com/northwesternmutual/kanali/pkg/tags"
  "github.com/northwesternmutual/kanali/pkg/log"
)
```

## Making a Change
Before making any significant changes, please [open an issue](https://github.com/northwesternmutual/kanali/issues). Discussing your proposed changes ahead of time will make the contribution process smooth for everyone.
